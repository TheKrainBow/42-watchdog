# üì° 42 Watchdog Webhook

A Golang-based HTTP server that listens to your school's access control system and posts daily attendance data for apprentices.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

* Go 1.21+
* systemd (Linux)
* A 42 API token
* A 42 Chronos API token
* Access control webhook support (from your school)

---

## üìá Architecture Overview

This project contains **two executables**:

* **watchdog-server**: The main HTTP service that listens to webhook events and manages users.
* **watchdog-client**: A CLI tool used to interact with the server (start/stop tracking, notify students, get status, etc.).

---

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repo & enter the project directory

```bash
cd live-attendance
```

### 2. Configure your credentials

```bash
cp config-default.yml config.yml
```

Edit `config.yml` with:

* Your 42 API token
* Your campus apprenticeship project IDs
* Discord/Slack webhook (if applicable)

### 3. Build locally (no install)

```bash
make local-build
```

This will compile the binaries to the current folder.

### 4. Install the server as a systemd service

```bash
make server-install
```

This will:

* Copy `watchdog-server` to `/usr/local/bin/`
* Copy your config to `/etc/watchdog/config.yml`
* Create a systemd unit at `/etc/systemd/system/watchdog.service`

### 5. Start the service

```bash
make server-start
```

### 6. View logs

```bash
make server-logs
```

### 7. Install autocompletion (optional)

```bash
make client-install-cmd-completion-zsh    # for zsh
make client-install-cmd-completion-bash   # for bash
```

### 8. Set up automated cron commands

```bash
make cron-setup
```

This installs:

* `watchdog-client start` at 07:30
* `watchdog-client notify` at 19:30
* `watchdog-client stop --post-attendance` at 20:30

## üîé Interacting with the server via CLI

```bash
watchdog-client start                   # Begin listening
watchdog-client stop                    # Stop listening
watchdog-client stop --post-attendance  # Stop & send attendance
watchdog-client status                  # View current user access states
watchdog-client notify                  # Notify students with low time
```

All commands are sent by default to `http://localhost:8080/commands` ‚Äî override with:

```bash
watchdog-client --url <custom-url> <command>
```
